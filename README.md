# FinalProject_NTI

This repository contains the code for the **Final Project** as part of the **DevOps & Automation** training at NTI.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a solution that integrates the technologies learned throughout the course to solve a real-world problem. This project showcases the implementation of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, and other automation tools.

## Features

- Docker containerization for all services
- Kubernetes deployment for scalability and high availability
- CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment
- Infrastructure automation using Terraform
- Configuration management with Ansible

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ammar-Abdelhady-ai/FinalProject_NTI.git
